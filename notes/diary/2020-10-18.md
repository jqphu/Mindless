New diary format! Trying to standardize on vimwiki :)

Just some casual Sunday programming. No major goals / milestones.

I was listening to How I Built This with Guy Raz and now motivated to build things again :P.
At least my hiatuses are shorter and shorter.

TODO:
* [X] Finish registration page
* [ ] Fix nullable issues (use ? to inidicate nullable)
* [ ] Add build watcher pubspec
* [X] Secure storage to persist login information

We will clear the secure storage when we press "logout" in the home page.
For now we never clear the secure storage.

Need up update SDK version for secure storage.
