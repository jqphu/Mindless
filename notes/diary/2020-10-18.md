## Start
New diary format! Trying to standardize on vimwiki :)

Just some casual Sunday programming. No major goals / milestones.

I was listening to How I Built This with Guy Raz and now motivated to build things again :P.
At least my hiatuses are shorter and shorter.

## During

TODO:
* [X] Finish registration page
* [X] Fix pedantic static analysis issues
~~* [ ] Add build watcher pubspec~~
  * This wasn't what I was expecting
* [X] Secure storage to persist login information

We will clear the secure storage when we press "logout" in the home page.
For now we never clear the secure storage.

Need up update SDK version for secure storage.

## End of day
We got registration done! Quite nice :) Also added some persistent storage.

Nice little chunk of work for today. Time to call it a day though.
