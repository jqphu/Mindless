Let's add some trivial habits by string.

Requirements:
1. Set once a day only.
2. Set by some arbitrary string for now (no hierarchy)

SQL Schema:
To test the schema manually.
1. `sqlite3 habits.db`   - Open the database.
2. `.read schema.sql`    - Creates the tables.
3. `.read test_data.sql` - Read in the dummy data.
4. `SELECT * FROM habit INNER JOIN habit_log ON habit.habit_id=habit_log.id` - Visualise the joined
   data.
